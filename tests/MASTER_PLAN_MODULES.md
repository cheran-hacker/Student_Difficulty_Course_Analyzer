# 🌌 MASTER PLAN: Next-Gen Application Modules

You requested **Requirement Modules**. Here is the definitive, architectural breakdown of the 5 Advanced Modules that will transform this application into a Global Talent OS.

## 1. 🧠 THE AI PREDICTION CORE (Module: `psi_core`)
**Objective:** Move beyond *displaying* grades to *predicting* outcomes.

*   **Dropout Probability Model:**
    *   *Input:* Attendance < 75% + Declining Feedback Sentiment.
    *   *Action:* Auto-alert sent to Faculty Advisor ("At-Risk Student Detected").
*   **Course Fit Algorithm:**
    *   *Concept:* "Netflix for Education".
    *   *Logic:* "Students who aced 'Data Structures' also rated 'Algorithms II' highly." -> Recommended Elective.
*   **Sentiment Heatmaps:**
    *   Visual overlay on the campus map showing "Stressed" vs "Happy" departments in real-time.

## 2. 🌍 THE SOCIAL NEURAL NETWORK (Module: `synapse_hub`)
**Objective:** Turn isolated study into collective intelligence.

*   **Live Lecture chat:**
    *   Ephemeral chat rooms that only exist during scheduled class times.
*   **Knowledge Bounties:**
    *   Student posts a hard question with a "50 XP Bounty".
    *   Peer answers; original poster awards the bounty.
*   **Anonymous "Vibe Check":**
    *   Weekly pulse surveys: "How is the workload this week?" (Too Light / Just Right / Overwhelming).

## 3. 🎮 GAMIFICATION ENGINE (Module: `xp_system`)
**Objective:** Dopamine-driven engagement loops.

*   **The "Streak" Mechanic:**
    *   "You've logged in for 50 days in a row! +5% XP Bonus."
*   **Rarity Tiers for Profiles:**
    *   Common (Gray) -> Rare (Blue) -> Epic (Purple) -> Legendary (Gold).
    *   Unlocked by contributing meaningful course reviews.
*   **Guilds (Clubs/Societies):**
    *   "Computer Science Guild" vs "Arts Guild" leaderboards.

## 4. 🛡️ FORTRESS SECURITY GRID (Module: `aegis_guard`)
**Objective:** Institutional-grade trust and safety.

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**
    *   Verify a student is enrolled without revealing their identity (for anonymous reporting).
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:**
    *   Detect account sharing by analyzing typing cadence and mouse movement patterns.
*   **Immutable Audit Trails:**
    *   Every grade change or feedback deletion is hashed and logged.

## 5. 📱 OMNI-CHANNEL PRESENCE (Module: `pocket_link`)
**Objective:** The campus in your pocket.

*   **PWA (Progressive Web App):**
    *   Installable on iOS/Android without an App Store.
*   **Proximity Alerts (Geo-fencing):**
    *   "You are near the Library. 3 of your study friends are checked in here."
*   **QR Check-in:**
    *   Scan QR code at lecture hall door to mark attendance automatically.

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1.  **AI Core** (High Value, Backend heavy) - *Start here for impact.*
2.  **Gamification** (High Engagement, Frontend heavy) - *Start here for fun.*
3.  **Social** (Complex, requires Socket.io) - *Start here for community.*
